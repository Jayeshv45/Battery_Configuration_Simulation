# Battery_Configuration_Simulation
Simulink Project for Configuring and Displaying Battery Voltage
# Battery Configuration and Voltage Display Simulation

## Project Description
This Simulink project demonstrates the configuration of a battery pack using cells arranged in a combination of series and parallel connections. Specifically, three cells are connected in series and three such series sets are connected in parallel. Each cell has a voltage of 3.7 volts. The combined output voltage is displayed using a bus selector.

## Features
- Configures a battery pack using series and parallel cell connections
- Displays the total voltage of the battery pack
- Utilizes a bus selector to extract and display relevant parameters

## Files Included
- `Battery_Configuration_Simulation.slx`: The Simulink model file
- `README.md`: Project description and details
- Optional: Additional documentation in the `docs` folder

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `Battery_Configuration_Simulation.slx` in MATLAB Simulink.
3. Run the simulation and observe the voltage reading displayed by the bus selector.
